# Hashtag Generator

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate suggestions of hashtags, for social media, given an article link.

The NLP is done by using the Aylien API while the frontend was developed using vanilla Javascript.

This project is the 4th project for the Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree program.
